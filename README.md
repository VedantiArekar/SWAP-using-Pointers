# SWAP-using-Pointers

We ask the user to enter values for variable a and b. We pass the address of variable a and b to function swap().

Inside function swap() we take a local variable temp. Since address of variable a and b are passed to swap() method, we take 2 pointer variables *x and *y. Pointer variable x holds the address of a and pointer variable y holds the address of b. Using below logic we swap the values present at address a( or x ) and b( or y ).


temp = *x;

*x = *y;

*y = temp;

Since we are directly changing the value present at particular address, the value gets reflected throughout the program and not just inside particular function. Thatâ€™s why we are able to print the result inside main function and the values of variable a and b are swapped, without getting any returned value from function swap().
